- **What's this?**: This is recreation of ChromeOS, made in quickshell for wayfire. It was designed to also fit with the Material 3 Expressive design language, and also a few other tweaks ...
- **This looks cool; should I use it?**: Not yet. Many things are not complete, including a settings menu, network and bluetooth menus, the launcher, and the notification history + calendar. It's best if you wait until those have been made.

### Notifications with no text, appname, or time appear with the default notification icon.

| **Description** | This issue is a well known issue with quickshell's notification server. It involves these "ghost" notifications, which are notifications that haven't been properly removed by the notification server. |
| **Timing** | This happens mostly while I'm editing code, so it shouldn't effect the user |
| **Workaround** | Force quickshell to discard all the notifications by clicking on the dashboard's "Clear" button. |
