> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might notice that all the code/configs are gone. This is because I'm doing a complete refactor, as well as switching to using [`Quickshell`](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me/) for the widgets.
> If you would like to read the old code, check [here](https://github.com/dealerofallthecats/fibreglass/tree/old), or look through the branches.

## Known Issues

### Notifications with no text, appname, or time appear with the default notification icon.

| Key | Content |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | This issue is a well known issue with quickshell's notification server. It involves these "ghost" notifications, which are notifications that haven't been properly removed by the notification server. |
| **Timing** | This happens mostly while I'm editing code, so it shouldn't effect the user |
| **Workaround** | Force quickshell to discard all the notifications by clicking on the dashboard's "Clear" button. |
